# PheonixProject

In this project the server side is completed and includes the relevant controllers, models, and API.
I had problems with linking the Angular to my project, in terms of passing parameters from the Angular side to the server.
If I had more time, my plan was to use HttpClient library of Angular and the post Method in order to send the search parameter to the server's controller.
The whole logic of the servers side - exists.
